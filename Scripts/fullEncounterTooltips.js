    [ [`Eevee is extremely versatile, and you can have nearly every evolution of Eevee at the moment. If you save and reload, you can also get yourself a female Eevee and breed it. Every evolution if Eevee is useable, though some or more versatile than others. Most Eeveelutions suffer a little from lack of coverage, though some can learn moves of a similar type. Here's a breakdown of how each Eeveelution can be used:
    <br><br>
    Tank: Vaporeon and Umbreon have very high Special Defense. Vaporeon invests more into its HP pool, while Umbreon has much higher Defense than Vaporeon. Vaporeon can also offer good damage output with good Special Attack and also be your Surfer if you need one, and it can also learn Ice-type coverage. Umbreon learns Moonlight, which can really help its staying power against a lot of threats, though its offensive presence is lacking.
    <br><br>
    Physical Damage: Flareon and Leafeon are very powerful physical Attackers, but you can't get Leafeon until later. Flareon is slower, but has higher Attack has a lot of Special bulk, while Leafeon is faster, is physically defensive, and is slightly weaker offensively. Both suffer from lack of coverage, with with naturally only learning Normal-type and their respective-type moves, and even with TMs their options are limited. But, for their types, they are very powerful physical Attackers, and their early moves aren't too bad. Flareon will get Fire Fang if you evolve it before level 20, and Leafeon will get Razor Leaf on evolution and, at the point where you can get Leafeon, Leaf Blade soon.
    <br><br>
    Special Damage: Espeon and Jolteon are the special counterparts to Flareon and Leafeon. Jolteon is the fastest of the bunch, but it also has the worst movepool of the three. It will learn the very weak Thunder Shock when it evolves, but it won't get another Special Electric-type move until Thunder at level 45. It also has virtually no coverage, with Hidden Power and some Normal-type moves being its only options. Espeon has the higher Special Attack, with Espeon being faster and Glaceon being bulkier. Espeon can learn Psybeam at level 20, which is a fine move for this point in the game and it'll get Psychic at level 37.
    <br><br>
    Flexible: Sylveon and Glaceon are very flexible in their roles. Sylveon has similar stats to Espeon, but its movepool of Misty Terrain and Light Screen makes it very easy to be a supportive tank rather than an offensive threat. It can still go on the offensive with moves such as Moonblast at level 37, though its stuck with just Fairy Wind before then. You can't get Glaceon for a long time, but once you do it is very bulky both physically and specially, and can even boost its physical Defense even more with Barrier and be annoying with Hail and Substitude.

    <br><br>
    As Mothim, it will immediately learn Quiver Dance on evolving, making it a very formidable threat stat-wise. In terms of movepool, it will have Hidden Power if it evolved at level 20, Confusion at level 23, and Gust at 26. All relatively weak moves, but can work if Mothim is boosted enough. It won't learn any strong moves until way later, so Mothim will be reliant on TMs to keep its movepool strong enough.
    <br><br>
    As Wormadam, the Pokemon will be much more bulky than its counterpart, although how bulky exactly depends on its form. The common point though is that all three forms are very, very slow. In its Plant-Cloak form, most of its stats are in the special side, having very high Special Defense and good Special Attack. It's Bug/Grass typing makes it have large advantages against certain Pokemon, but is also very disadvantaged against any Fire-type or Flying-type coverage. In Sandy-Cloak form, its typing is much more neutral as Ground-type counteracts a lot of Bug-type weaknesses. It's stats in this form are shifted to be more physical, with high Defense and good Attack. Finally, the Trash-Cloak form gives it a lot of resistances from its additional Steel-type, but still makes it very weak to Fire. It's stats here are evenly spread, with equally good Defense and Special Defense, and low damage stats across both physical and special. All forms movepool is largely the same, as all forms get a few Psychic-type moves such as Psybeam, but every form gets one or two of its secondary type such as Razor Leaf, Rock Blast, or Mirror Shot.
    <br><br>
    Of course, which one you get is largely dependant on your luck, as Burmy is already at a very low find rate on a non-guarenteed Headbutt, then there's gender chances and form chances into play.

Dusk Form gets No Guard, which allows it to guarentee Stone Edge hits. Dusk Form gets Tough Claws, which boosts its contact moves.

    [ ["Fomantis' stats are generally very middling, and its speed is very low. It does learn Growth which can boost its Attack and Special Attack, and learns Razor Leaf very early to take advantage of some Double Battles that are coming up. It can also learn Leaf Blade at level 23, which is just after the first gym. If you're lucky, it can also have the ability Contrary, which lets your stats get boosted rather than lowered. The biggest downside to Fomantis is that it evolves at level 34, which is a long time to be stuck with a poor-stated Pokemon like Fomantis. But for the first little while, it is a perfectly serviceable Grass type."], ], //Fomantis

It is, however, 4x weak to Poison, but other than that it can do very well against many threats.
