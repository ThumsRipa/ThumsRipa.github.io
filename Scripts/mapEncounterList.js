If you have Hustle, Alolan Rattata/Raticate will hit incredibly hard against anything that doesn't resist it. It is 4x weak to fighting, which is relatively common throughout the game. In the early game, this won't be as much of a problem, but as early as the second gym Alolan Raticate can start to struggle due to its lower speed."],

The main advantage of Patrat will be that it learns Bite at level 6, and gets Crunch as early as level 16. It won't get STAB on this move, but if you evolve it at level 20 it can definitely run through teams very quickly. As a Watchog, it can carry itself through the early to mid game, but once other Pokemon can take advantage of its lower Speed and low defenses Watchog is very difficult to use."],

As a Pidgeot, it's still fast with lackluster offensive stats, and its movepool doesn't help either. Most of its preferred moves are learned all the way in the level 60's. It can still be used if you need a Flying type in the early game, but it may not be the most useful past that."],

That is, assuming it survives a blow."],

It's Attack is much higher than its Special Attack, but it doesn't learn a Physical Flying-type move until level 66 as an Unfezant. If you do get a Pidove with Super Luck, you can run a gimmicky set with Air Cutter at level 15 and try to crit your way to victory. Ultimately, it can be used but it's movepool is very poor for its stats."],

By level 20, it can have access to moves such as Headbutt and Hyper Fang, both very powerful STAB moves. It can help you through the early game just fine, but by mid game you would most likely want to change it for a different Pokemon. Like games in the past, Headbutt can also be used to shake Pokemon from trees, so if you want Bibarel to reprise its past role, the option is still there."],

As a Beautifly, you'll have very high Special Attack and decent Speed, but you'll be relying on Gust for most of the early game until you get Air Cutter at level 20. Dustox on the other hand, will not hit as hard but is much more bulky. It also gets access to Confusion, which can be useful against the first gym. Both Pokemon can also heal themself using Morning Sun or Moonlight. Like a lot of Bug types, Wurmple evolves really early but will fall off quickly."],

For the early game, it's stuck with the early stat redicuing moves of Growl and Sand Attack. It can run Assist to take moves from your team, but that strategy is very luck-reliant. It's attacking moves aren't great either, with Fury Swipes, Scratch, and Pursuit being your options before the first gym. If you do want to use a Prankster Liepard, you can get Purrloin and wait until the level limit is higher before using it."],

It does have high attack, but it has so many type weaknesses that it's difficult to find an opportunity to use it properly.

Oddish in general does this job better than Paras though, even if it is 7-8 levels later."],

It does learn Magical Leaf at level 19, which allows it to be less reliant on Leech Seed damage. It won't evolve until you beat the first gym, and with its disadvantage against the first gym, using Cherubi can be a bit of a challenge."],

It won't get many other moves until level 41 though, so you're stuck with those two moves for a while. There are other birds available at this point, but Fearow's amazing Speed and Attack can still last a while longer."],

In theory, you can evolve it right away as you can find a Leaf Stone in Gearen Park, where it is caught. However, it will no longer learn new moves after it evolves. Because of this, you'll want to wait until it learns Seed Bomb at level 22, which is after the first gym. As a Pansage, it's stuck with Vine Whip and Bite, which are not the strongest moves for it. Simisage also falls of after the first few gyms, as its speed and offensive stats can't keep up with other Pokemon."],
        ['300', ['14%'], "In all honesty, Skitty is not a good Pokemon to use. It's highest stat is its speed, but its Attack and Special Attack are so poor that it can't put that Speed to good use. It can learn a wide range of supportive moves, such as Heal Bell, but that will come way later in the level 30's. If you do choose to use it, good luck."],
        ['513', ['10%'], "Pansear gets the best deal out of the elemental monkeys, as it learns Incinerate before level 20. As most gym leaders and story trainers often have their Pokemon carry berries, Incinerate can be very useful in a pinch. On top of that, if it is about to faint, its speed can let Yawn to put the opponent to sleep. It can also learn Bite for some coverage, and at level 22 it gets Flame Burst. Unfortunately, a Fire Stone is still a ways away, so you'll be stuck with Pansear for a little while."],
        ['515', ['10%'], "Panpour suffers the same issues as Pansage, in that in the early game it does not get the moves that it wants. It learns Scald at level 22, which will need to wait until after the first gym. The Water Stone is also far away, so you're stuck with Panpour for a bit. Panpour will have Water Gun and Bite through the early game, and it also learns Water Sport if you're stuck against a Fire-type team."],
        ['753', ['10%'], "Fomantis' stats are generally very middling, and its speed is very low. It does learn Growth which can boost its Attack and Special Attack, and learns Razor Leaf very early to take advantage of some Double Battles that are coming up. It can also learn Leaf Blade at level 23, which is just after the first gym. If you're lucky, it can also have the ability Contrary, which lets your stats get boosted rather than lowered. The biggest downside to Fomantis is that it evolves at level 34, which is a long time to be stuck with a poor-stated Pokemon like Fomantis. But for the first little while, it is a perfectly serviceable Grass type."],

It's uniqueness lies in its ability to learn Toxic Spikes very early at level 7, meaning it might have already learned it when you caught it. It also has access to Recycle, which means it can keep churning out Oran Berries in the early game to consume and let the poison kill the opponent. This works in its favor, as it does not have the offensive stats to really hurt anything. It can Acid Spray to continuously lower the enemy's Special Defense and pave way for other Pokemon. Trubbish evolves very late at level 36, and even as a Garbodor will struggle to deal with the threats in that part of the game. But for the early game, it can definitely stall out a lot of enemies."],

It can Poison the enemy and Amnesia to boost its already decent Special Defense as a stall mechanic, but it lacks the ability to heal itself unlike Trubbish. It's saving grace is that it does evolve a bit earlier than the others, at level 26, but that's about it."],

It learns Bite at level 9, but unfortunately that's the last Physical move it will learn until it evolves at level 22. And after that, the next physical move is leart at level 63. This means that Arbok is very much at the mercy of the TMs that are available, and there are not many that are useful for it.

Woobat/Swoobat also learns a variety of useful moves early, from Heart Stamp at level 15, Air Cutter at level 21, and Calm Mind at level 29. If you manage to get a Woobat with the ability Simple, Calm Mind can make it a very strong threat as the ability doubles your stat gains. Of course, all this relies on your dedication to increase its friendship, but even as a Woobat this Pokemon can be very useful, especially for the first gym."],

Once it does evolve, it is a very fast special sweeper, but that is very, very far away. If you do want a Noivern, it's recommended to put Noibat into a box until you have the level limit necessary to evolve it. Noibat as a Pokemon just isn't worth using."],
        ['109', ['4%'], "Koffing is the physically defensive Pokemon of the Poison types, boasting a base 95 defense. Like Gulpin and Trubbish, it relies on Poison damage to slowly chip away at the enemy's health. Koffing has the extra benefit of learning Clear Smog, meaning it prevents the enemy's Pokemon from setting up on it. While its base Defense stat is high, it's HP pool is very low, and it doesn't help that it evolves all the way at level 35. All in all, Koffing isn't the greatest Pokemon to use, but it does fulfill a specific niche, so if you want a staller that prevents setups, Koffing's a viable pick."],

Dusk Form gets No Guard, which allows it to guarentee Stone Edge hits. Dusk Form gets Tough Claws, which boosts its contact moves.

Upon leveling up Charjabug on Terajuma Island though, it will evolve into a Vikavolt, learning Thunderbolt immediately and gaining a lot of Special Attack.

The three physical moves it learns naturally are Pound at level 0, Fling at level 26, and Gunk Shot all the way at level 40. All this means that Grimer will struggle a lot until it gets a few good TMs under its belt. It also evolves very late at level 38. Grimer can play a gimmicky set with Disable and Minimize if you do choose to use it, but otherwise it may be better to wait until you have a few good TMs to properly use it.

However, it's movepool doesn't really complement it, with the strong moves being all the way in the early 40's. By then, it would be outclassed by other Pokemon. However, it can be played as a physical tank if it has the ability Intimidate. It can use Stockpile to boost its defenses and lay down layers of Toxic Spikes.

                    Geodude can be a very powerful Ground type with the right support. With its Rock/Ground typing, it is extremely weak to Water and Grass, both relatively common typings. It does learn powerful moves such as Magnitude, Smack Down, Self-Destruct and Bulldoze very early, and it also evolves at level 25. It is very slow, and has almost non-existant Special Defense, so it will need the right opportunity to truly shine. If you're willing to work around its weaknesses, the Geodude can be a very powerful addition to your team.

Thankfully, its movepool does complement this, as it learns Smack Down and Bug Bite very early on and even has Stealth Rocks at level 24 to help support its team. It does evolve a little later at level 31, but then it has natural access to Rock Slide, X-Scissor, and Shell Smash, all moves that can turn it into a monsterous sweeper. However, its Special Defense is non-existent, so use it with care.

                    Shuckle is best known for having the highest defenses of all the Pokemon, and practically 0 stats elsewhere. Because of its base 20 HP, it doesn't even function particularly well as a tank, and so it will have difficulty doing much of anything. If you catch it and save it though, at level 45 it can learn Power Split and Guard Split, which can be used to effectively negate the opponenet's offensive stat or boost your Pokemon's defensive stats. Before then though, best it can try for is Power Trick at level 31 to swap is Defense with its Attack and try to do damage with Rock Throw, or Rock Slide/Bug Bite at levels 38 and 42 respectively.

Butterfree also has the base stats to back up its move, and while has a type advantage against the second gym, does fall to Rock-type coverage easily. At this point, use Butterfree if its been useful to you, but there are other options available.

However, it still suffers from movepool issues as it won't have any strong moves to use other than from TMs. As a Pidgeot, it's still fast with lackluster offensive stats, and most of its preferred moves are learned all the way in the level 60's. It can still be used if you need a Flying type in the early game, but it may not be the most useful past that.

If you want, you can catch one then wait until level 31 when it evolves into a Forretress, where it gains the Steel-type and a whole lot of resistances. Here, it will finally learn entry hazard moves and be able to function as a suicide lead well.

                    Crabrawler has a very high Attack stat for a first-stage Pokemon, and also has decent Speed and physical bulk. It also learns Rock Smash naturally, along with Pursuit and Dizzy Punch for good neutral coverage and Power-Up Punch to boost its Attack stat even more. Even as it levels up, it gains good moves in Payback due to its low Speed, and Crabhammer. Its main drawback is its evolution timing, as it can only evolve into Crabominable in certain places, the earliest of which is at the near the the seventh badge. While Crabominable is definitely worth it, other Fighting-type Pokemon will be available then that has a lot of immediate power compared to Crabrawler.

                    <span class="wildPokemonTooltip">
                    Aipom has a high Attack and Speed stat, but doesn't quite have the movepool to take full advantage of its stats. What it does have is a very large TM movepool, allowing it to learn a new move almost everytime a new TM is picked up. One of its advantages is learning Baton Pass naturally, and in the late stages of the game it can function very well as a support Baton Pass for special attackers, being able to learn both Agility and Nasty Plot. However, that is very late into the game in the level 30's, and it will evolve into Ambipom at level 33 at the earliest when it learns Double Hit. It may be more practical to catch an Aipom and wait until the level limit is high enough to take full advantage.

                    Butterfree is an early game powerhouse. Butterfree learns a large range of moves very early, getting Gust when it evolves, all 3 powder-type moves at level 13, Confusion at level 11 and Psybeam at level 17, and even Silver Wind at level 19. Butterfree also has the base stats to back up its move, and while has a type advantage against the second gym, does fall to Rock-type coverage easily. At this point, use Butterfree if its been useful to you, but there are other options available.

                    #412 Burmy
                    <span class="wildPokemonTooltip">
                    Burmy will evolve into either Mothim or Wormadam depending on its gender, and each of those two serve different purposes, especially the different forms of Wormadam. Before you read all of this though, generally speaking they are not very worthwhile Pokemon to use in the long term.
                    <br><br>
                    As Mothim, it will immediately learn Quiver Dance on evolving, making it a very formidable threat stat-wise. In terms of movepool, it will have Hidden Power if it evolved at level 20, Confusion at level 23, and Gust at 26. All relatively weak moves, but can work if Mothim is boosted enough. It won't learn any strong moves until way later, so Mothim will be reliant on TMs to keep its movepool strong enough.
                    <br><br>
                    As Wormadam, the Pokemon will be much more bulky than its counterpart, although how bulky exactly depends on its form. The common point though is that all three forms are very, very slow. In its Plant-Cloak form, most of its stats are in the special side, having very high Special Defense and good Special Attack. It's Bug/Grass typing makes it have large advantages against certain Pokemon, but is also very disadvantaged against any Fire-type or Flying-type coverage. In Sandy-Cloak form, its typing is much more neutral as Ground-type counteracts a lot of Bug-type weaknesses. It's stats in this form are shifted to be more physical, with high Defense and good Attack. Finally, the Trash-Cloak form gives it a lot of resistances from its additional Steel-type, but still makes it very weak to Fire. It's stats here are evenly spread, with equally good Defense and Special Defense, and low damage stats across both physical and special. All forms movepool is largely the same, as all forms get a few Psychic-type moves such as Psybeam, but every form gets one or two of its secondary type such as Razor Leaf, Rock Blast, or Mirror Shot.
                    <br><br>
                    Of course, which one you get is largely dependant on your luck, as Burmy is already at a very low find rate on a non-guarenteed Headbutt, then there's gender chances and form chances into play. Both Mothim and Wormadam are typically not worth the amount of thought needed to use them correctly, speaking overall.

It does have a chance of having the ability Lightning Rod, becoming a Water-type that is immune to Electric-type moves.

                    Barboach is a Pokemon that relies on its evolution to be useful. Fortunately, it will evolve at level 30 which is right around the third gym. By then, it will have two strong, but somewhat unreliable, STAB moves in both Aqua Tail and Magnitude. Past that, it does get Earthquake very early at level 34 and Thrash when it evolves. Its stats are still pretty poor though, so even with powerful moves it may be doing much less damage than expected.

After the first gym, t'll learn Electro Ball at level 22 to take advantage of its Speed, and Self-Destruct at level 26 to go out with a bang.

After the first gym, it will struggle a little due to its defenses, and it evolves at level 26 which is after the second gym. You can get around this by using a Rare Candy to forcibly level it up, then use a Reverse Candy to put it back in obedience range. Floatzel's defenses are still very lacking, but its extremely high Attack and Speed make it a very powerful sweeper once the opponent's team is weak enough."],

Due to its speed, it will almost always get a maximum power Electro Ball, which it learns at level 13, but that's about the most damaging move it can get. We'll be able to get a Thunderstone very soon, but once it evolves, it won't learn any more moves naturally so you'll have to wait for Pikachu to learn the moves it wants at very late levels. This can be mitigated some by the Move Relearner, which we'll have access to during the next badge. Alolan Raichu is also obtainable, but that will have to wait until much, much later in the game. Pichu/Pikachu/Raichu are very tricky Pokemon to raise, so it might be a good idea to wait for the level limit to reach what you want rather than using it in battle."],

It's early movepool isn't great, learning weaker moves such as Poison Sting or Double Kick until it gets Bite as a Nidorina at level 23. From there, it goes through another period of move drought until Toxic Spikes at level 35 and Crunch at level 43, but you'll probably want to evolve it into a Nidoqueen before then.

It'll get Pursuit and Spark at levels 22 and 25 respectively, and with Flame Charge already learned it has very good coverage. It'll evolve soon after the second gym at level 27, and from there continue to be a good damage threat until the fourth or fifth gym.

It can also have the very useful ability Dry Skin to take advantage of switch ins, or Solar Power to hit much harder in the sun. On the other hand, its movepool is very poor, having only Thundershock until level 25 where it learns Parabolic Charge. It also evolves with the Sun Stone, which you can get at the earliest after the fourth gym. All these factors mean that Helioptile will work out in the early game, but won't carry its own weight much in the midgame until you come across a Sun Stone.

Depending on luck, a Shiny Stone before the second gym is also possible, but you might need to save and reset the game a few times before the Shiny Stone is obtained.

        Tank: Vaporeon and Umbreon have very high Special Defense. Vaporeon invests more into its HP pool, while Umbreon has much higher Defense than Vaporeon. Vaporeon can also offer good damage output with good Special Attack and also be your Surfer if you need one, and it can also learn Ice-type coverage. Umbreon learns Moonlight, which can really help its staying power against a lot of threats, though its offensive presence is lacking.

        Physical Damage: Flareon and Leafeon are very powerful physical Attackers, but you can't get Leafeon until later. Flareon is slower, but has higher Attack has a lot of Special bulk, while Leafeon is faster, is physically defensive, and is slightly weaker offensively. Both suffer from lack of coverage, with with naturally only learning Normal-type and their respective-type moves, and even with TMs their options are limited. But, for their types, they are very powerful physical Attackers, and their early moves aren't too bad. Flareon will get Fire Fang if you evolve it before level 20, and Leafeon will get Razor Leaf on evolution and, at the point where you can get Leafeon, Leaf Blade soon.
        <br><br>
        Special Damage: Espeon and Jolteon are the special counterparts to Flareon and Leafeon. Jolteon is the fastest of the bunch, but it also has the worst movepool of the three. It will learn the very weak Thunder Shock when it evolves, but it won't get another Special Electric-type move until Thunder at level 45. It also has virtually no coverage, with Hidden Power and some Normal-type moves being its only options. Espeon has the higher Special Attack, with Espeon being faster and Glaceon being bulkier. Espeon can learn Psybeam at level 20, which is a fine move for this point in the game and it'll get Psychic at level 37.
        <br><br>
        Flexible: Sylveon and Glaceon are very flexible in their roles. Sylveon has similar stats to Espeon, but its movepool of Misty Terrain and Light Screen makes it very easy to be a supportive tank rather than an offensive threat. It can still go on the offensive with moves such as Moonblast at level 37, though its stuck with just Fairy Wind before then. You can't get Glaceon for a long time, but once you do it is very bulky both physically and specially, and can even boost its physical Defense even more with Barrier and be annoying with Hail and Substitude. It can also give Speed control to its team with Icy Wind, or go offensive with Hail and Blizzard way later in the game.`],
