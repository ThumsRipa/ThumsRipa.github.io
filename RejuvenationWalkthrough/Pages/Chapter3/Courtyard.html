        <img class="centeredImage" src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/GoldenPortal.png">
        <br>
        Head back over to East Gearen City via TRUCKGUY, and head over to Venam's gym to look for her. Talk to person right inside the gym, and he'll let you know that Venam went over to the sewers to check out a new area that opened up. With that, prepare your items and we can head over to Gearen Sewers. Head over to the top right area, and then step through the golden portal.
        <br>
        <p class="subsectionHeader">Chrysalis Courtyard<span class="showTrainersButtonAnchor"><button class="showTrainersButton" id="CourtyardTrainersButton" onclick="showTrainerTable('CourtyardTrainers')">Show Trainers</button></span></p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Courtyard.png">
        <br>
        <table class="TrainerTable" id="CourtyardTrainers">
        </table>
        <br>
        Once you enter the courtyard, you'll find Venam along with two of her friends in front of a large gate. We'll have to help them find a way to get past the gates. There's a new set of encounters here, and battles in the courtyard are fought in the <a class="continueElsewhere" href="../Information/FieldEffects-Elemental.html#GrassyTerrain" target="_blank">Grassy Terrain.</a> Head over to the right first, and take note of <span class="ImportantName">Password 3.<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Password3.png"></span></span> Then head over to the left side, the hole all the way on the left leads to a PP Up. Go back to the second hole from the left, and then head all the way over to the right and grab the shining key. Open the gate, and the group will find that the key doesn't work for the second gate. Go back to the gate house, smash the back wall, and then head deeper into the courtyard.
        <br><br>
        The group will find themselves in front of a yellow mansion. Go ahead and follow Venam and co. into the mansion through the window. You'll be introduced to <span class="ImportantName">Indriad Theolia,<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Indriad.png"></span></span> who will exposite a little before teleporting the four of you away. Once you wake up, a blond-haired girl would let you know that she freed you, and that you should get away. You can heal by interacting with the bed here, and access your PC with the PC Star.
        <br><br>
        Head upstairs and enter the left side room. The girl will introduce herself as <span class="ImportantName">Marianette,<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Marianette.png"></span></span> and after a little conversation she'll agree to help you find Venam and the others. Head out of the room, and talk to the maid by the second floor staircase. She'll send you on a trial, which Marianette explains is normal around here. Head downstairs, all the way to the lobby, and go underneath the rightside stairs into the dining room. Above the dining room, you'll find the <span class="ImportantName">maid that was slacking off.<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Maid_Find.png"></span></span> She'll also set a trial for you to find her hidden bracelet. The <span class="ImportantName">bracelet<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Bracelet.png"></span></span> is located outside the front door of the mansion, through a hole hidden by the tall grass on the right. Go back and return the bracelet, and the you'll be challenge to <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="normalTrainerName" id="ServantEllieName">a battle.<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/ServantEllie.png"></span></a> Afterwards, you'll now have access to the third floor, so head all the way back up and into Indriad's room. After a conversation between Indriad and Marianette, you'll now be able to clear the three trials to save Venam and the others. 
        <br><br>
        Before we move ahead with the three trials, speak to the maid in the lobby to start a hidden trail. She'll let you know that there are three maids scattered around the courtyard, and if we defeat all three she'll have a reward for us. Our first stop is out the front gate. The first trial is inside the Absol statue, but go past that and to the Gardevoir statue first. Interact with the statue, and the maid beside the statue will give you a <span class="ImportantName">Gothita.<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Gothita.png"></span></span> To the left of the Gardevoir statue, hidden in the trees, is 
        <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="normalTrainerName" id="ServantDeandraName">Servant Deandra,<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/ServantDeandra.png"></span></a> our first opponent of the three hidden maids.
        <br><br>
        <p class="subsectionHeader">The First Trial</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Trial1.png">
        <br>
        Once you're done, head back to the Absol statue and enter it. This trial, we'll have to figure out which of the four apparitions are telling the truth. For the answers, they are: <span class="textSpoilers">Venam: Bottom Left, Ren: Bottom Right, Aelita: Top Left</span>. After that, you'll be able to go through the mirror and rescue Venam.
        <br><br>
        <p class="subsectionHeader">The Second Trial</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Trial2.png">
        <br>
        For the second trial, head through the path under the stairs on the left side, opposite of the dining room. You'll find yourself in a hedge maze. First, you'll want to head up from the very first fork, as there are a few items, <span class="ImportantName">Password 1,<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Password1.png"></span></span> and most importantly the <span class="ImportantName">Poolside Key.<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/PoolsideKey.png"></span></span> We'll need the key to complete the third area. In the middle of the maze is also <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="normalTrainerName" id="ServantLaraName">Servant Lara,<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/ServantLara.png"></span></a> the second hidden maid. From there, head on all the way left then up, and you'll rescue one of Venam's friend.
        <br><br>
        <p class="subsectionHeader">The Third Trial</p>
        <img class="centeredImage" src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Trial3.png">
        <br>
        The final trial is past the dining room area, to the poolside. In the top left corner is a hole in the hedge where we can get <span class="ImportantName">Password 2<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Password2.png"></span></span> and in the bottom right we can battle <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="normalTrainerName" id="ServantYaraName">Servant Yara.<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/ServantYara.png"></span></a> With that we have completed the hidden maid trial, but we'll go get the rewards later. First, head to the top right corner and unlock the door of the building with the key we found in the maze. Head back out, and you'll find that there's a hidden chamber in the pool. Head inside, and you'll have to control Marianette through a puzzle. The portal you want is in the bottom left corner, and from there is a straightforward path.
        <br><br>
        Once you've completed the trail and saved Venam's last friend, head back out. Marianette will be taken by the maids, and we'll have to enter through the double doors in the lobby area. Before that, talk to the maid in the lobby, and she'll unlock most of the doors in the mansion. There are two rooms with four useful items each, the first is on the path to the maze and the second is on the second floor on the right side. You can also go back to the room with the bed, and the door in the back is now unlocked. Go through that door, and you'll need to unlock the ornate door using the three passwords: <span class="textSpoilers">7896, 3135, 8187</span>. Once you've unlocked it, head deeper into the room and you'll find <span class="ImportantName">Anju.<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 3/ChrysalisCourtyard/Anju.png"></span></span> She'll be surprised that you're not Indriad, and ask you a few questions. To get a secret item, answer truthfully: The world is fine, Sheridan is fine, but Hiyoshi City is destroyed. She'll give you Anju's Pendant, which will give us access to a sidequest in 4 badges.
        <br><br>
        Leave the prison, and that'll be everything we can do for the moment. Once you're ready, you can head through the double doors in the lobby and all the way along the path to engage the Final Trial.
