        Once you enter the tower's basement, you'll be greeted by Geara. He'll head deeper into the laboratory, closing the door behind him. For this section, Mosely will be following you around and healing your Pokemon, but she won't help you during battles. To open the doors, we'll need to activate four colored panels. Take the right path first and go downstairs, battling <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="normalTrainerName" id="TeamXenDanniName">Team Xen Danni<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 4/WispyTower/Trainers/TeamXenDanni.png"></span></a> and <span class="ImportantName">activating the green panel.<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 4/WispyTower/GreenPanel.png"></span></span> Head back upstairs, then down the right set of stairs. You'll have to battle <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="normalTrainerName" id="TeamXenMalikName">Team Xen Malik<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 4/WispyTower/Trainers/TeamXenMalik.png"></span></a> first and then <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="normalTrainerName" id="TeamXenSheilaName">Team Xen Sheila<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 4/WispyTower/Trainers/TeamXenSheila.png"></span></a> at the intersection. Head left, and defeat <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="normalTrainerName" id="TeamXenSheilaName">Team Xen Layla.<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 4/WispyTower/Trainers/TeamXenLayla.png"></span></a> The left room here has a <span class="ImportantName">red panel<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 4/WispyTower/RedPanel.png"></span></span> and a <span class="ImportantName">Healing Machine<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 4/WispyTower/HealingSpot.png"></span></span> as well as a PC. You can also interact with the purple paper on the north side of the room to read about what happened.
        <br><br>
        Head back to the main room, then go down the right branch this time to battle <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="normalTrainerName" id="TeamXenCeciliaName">Team Xen Cecilia.<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 4/WispyTower/Trainers/TeamXenCecilia.png"></span></a> The room past her contains a <span class="ImportantName">blue panel<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 4/WispyTower/BluePanel.png"></span></span> as well as another journal entry. Finally, back to the main room and head north. There's a locked gate in this room that we can't go through yet, but meanwhile <span class="ImportantName">activate teh yellow panel<span class="normalTrainerImage"><img class=normalTrainerMap src="../../images/Screenshots/Chapter 4/WispyTower/YellowPanel.png"></span></span> and read another journal entry. With that, we've unlocked all the panels and so Mosely will head off before us. Heal up either in the lab or back at the Wispy Path-Wispy Tower gate, then follow Mosely and Narcissa down the center stairs.
        <br><br>
        Down the stairs, you'll find a familiar duo in Sharon and Eli, who managed to lock Narcissa and Mosely behind a door. As per usual, they'll battle you.

        They've got a solid team this time, but nothing too threatening. Tangela and Lickitung are there to slow your team down and weaken you for Honchkrow and Mismagius. As long as you don't let Mismagius set up with Calm Mind or let Honchkrow get too many Moxie boosts, this battle shouldn't be too difficult. You can always focus on just one of them to turn the battle into a 2v1. Once you defeat them, they'll open the door for you and then leave. Before you follow Narcissa and Mosely down deeper, go back and heal up for a tough battle coming up. Once your ready, head all the way down, read a final journal entry if you want, and then enter the room to meet Geara and a chained Giratina. After some conversation, you'll be thrown into a battle against Geara.

        Geara has a very strong team, where his first four Pokemon try to spread status to let Giratina and Haunter unleash very powerful Hex's. Both his leads in Persian and Marowak have extremely large coverage and complement each other very well. Marowak with a Thick Club can quickly sweep your team, so take it out quickly. If you're able to Burn or Paralyze Persian, it won't be too much of a threat so you can focus on just one side of the field. Masquerain has Intimidate and Struggle Bug, so it'll try to weaken you for the next battlers, but otherwise a strong Rock-type move will take it out quickly. Clefairy is a very strong support Pokemon with Follow Me, redirecting any attacks to it to let its partner get free damage. It also has an Eviolite, making it surprisingly tanky.
        <br><br>
        His final two Pokemon are his final damage dealers. Haunter will try to spread status before using Hex, which will deal large amounts of damage to your team. Otherwise, it is pretty frail so you can get rid of it pretty quickly if you're not Paralyzed. His Giratina is not as frail, and can still hit very hard with Shadow Claw, Dragon Claw, or, if you're status'ed, Hex. Ideally, you'll want to turn the battle into a 2v1 against this thing, so if you left Persian alive you can kill it before focusing your attention onto Giratina. Like other threats, status effects can go a long way. Paralysis means you won't be outsped, and Burn means that it won't be hitting as hard with Shadow Claw or Dragon Claw. As long as you turned the battle into a 2v1 and still have some Pokemon in your tank, you should be able to muscle past Geara.
        <br><br>
        If you're really having trouble, Lycanroc with Rock Slide and Ribombee with Dazzling Gleam can perform very well in this battle. If you got the Mime Jr. from Caratos Mountain, it will have Icy Wind so you can slow Giratina and his other threats down, though you have to be careful of his Ghost-type moves. If your stater evolves at level 36, you can also use a Rare Candy to evolve it before lowering it with a Reverse Candy to be within the level limit. Electric-types such as Pachirisu, Zebstrika, or Dedenne are immune to Paralysis and can also inflict it back onto his team to give yourself the advantage. The Throh we got earlier has Knock Off, so you can use that to get rid of the Eviolites to make the fight easier. Finally, there are a few Pokemon that can learn the move Mist, which will protect everyone including the enemy team from status effects while turning the field into a <a class="continueElsewhere" href="../Information/FieldEffects-Elemental.html/MistyTerrain" target="_blank">Misty Terrain</a> for three turns, so if you can take advantage there that is also a viable strategy.
        <br><br>
        Once you defeat Geara, Narcissa will banish him to the Shadow Realm. The rest of you will leave and have food at Narcissa's house, where Aelita is waiting. Mosely will leave, and Narcissa and Aelita will be waiting at the gym. We could go challenge her now, but there are a few things we can do before that. If you want to skip to the gym and do these sidequests later, you can do so <a class="continueElsewhere" href="GoldenleafGym.html">here.</a>
